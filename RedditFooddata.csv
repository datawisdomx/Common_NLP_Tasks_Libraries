Vietnamese use plenty of cilantro in other dishes but not to wilt in a soup. Lime is a garnish with bean sprouts and basil adding it to the broth while cooking dulls it.  Also completely missing fish sauce roasted ginger and cardamom pods. Uncle Roger would not approve without msg.  This is a Jaime Oliver version not even Gordon Ramsay.

i9il7cw,2022-05-21 18:42:26,Big_Chungus4200,uuv8as,[Homemade] Breakfast Italian sausage apple smoked bacon eggs waffles with strawberry compote and a hash brown,Uhh.. what? I mean we call it that just because thats what its called. We dont all individually wake up and decide to describe them as Italian Sausages. Off the top of my head if Im eating Italian Sausages Im going to expect some vast array of seasonings like basil or maybe fennel etc. and a noticeable casing holding what is most likely pork unless otherwise noted.   Same thing with swiss cheese or french toast. America is a massive melting pot with cultural influence from all over the world. So its a word in my language that is used in my country through the lens of my cultural perspective to convey specific meaning. Thats what its called. It doesnt matter what kind of or how many sausages in Italy they make. I mean dude half the world calls what the US calls French fries Belgian fries.   You can theory whatever you want and trace back etymology and debate cultural appropriation but at the end of the day if you go to a Waffle House and ask for eggy bread with a side of bangers theyre gonna have a conniption and youre probably not gonna get your breakfast.  Language lives and breathes through use and communication. Nothing else matters.   I mean man I understand where youre coming from but this is a weird thing to call out Americans for when its literally just a function of natural language and communication - see Chinese people calling apps A-P-Ps Korean people calling corn dogs hot dogs... I could go on.  Imo you totally could have posed this as an open ended question about American food instead of observing an entire culture top-down and just telling us it doesnt make any sense when there is a clear reason why this happens.,i9i8bii,/r/food/comments/uuv8as/homemade_breakfast_italian_sausage_apple_smoked/i9il7cw/'

i9i094s,2022-05-21 15:34:04,CaptainWisconsin,uuxo34,[Homemade] Pumpkin cranberry pecan scones with brandy brown butter drizzle,Recipe  Scones  2 cups flour  2 1/2 tsp baking powder  1 tsp cinnamon  1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice  1/2 tsp salt  1/2 cup very cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2 cubes  1/3 cup + 2 tbsp heavy cream separated  1 egg  1/2 cup pumpkin pur√©e*  1/2 cup brown sugar  1 tsp vanilla extract  1/3 cup dried cranberries  1/3 cup toasted pecans roughly chopped  *These scones are very light and moist - almost cake-like. If you prefer them a bit more dry and dense (i.e. traditional) cook the pumpkin pur√©e in a saut√© pan over medium-high heat for a few minutes. This helps eliminate some of the moisture in the pur√©e thus making a more dense scone.  Glaze  2 tbsp unsalted butter  3 tbsp real maple syrup  1 cup powdered sugar  2 tsp brandy  Pinch of salt  Preheat oven to 400¬∞ and line a baking tray with parchment paper.  Whisk together the flour baking powder cinnamon pumpkin pie spice and salt. Drop in the cubes of cold butter and work into the flour mixture until it resembles wet sand - you can use a food processor pastry blender or your hands.  In a separate bowl whisk together 1/3 cup heavy cream the egg pumpkin pur√©e brown sugar and vanilla extract.  Pour the wet mixture into the dry and use a rubber spatula to mix until loosely combined. Add the dried cranberries and pecans then continue mixing until a smooth dough forms.  Work the dough into a ball then turn out onto a floured surface. Press the dough into a flat 8‚Äù disc then use a sharp knife to cut into 8 wedges.  Place the wedges on the baking pan 2‚Äù apart then brush with the 2 tbsp of heavy cream (you can also sprinkle with a bit of coarse sugar too for a little crunch).  Bake 20-25 minutes until golden brown (internal temp ought to be 190-200¬∞). Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack.  To make the glaze begin by melting the 2 tbsp of butter in a sauce pan over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter stirring often until the milk solids begin to brown and smell nutty - 7-8 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the maple syrup and brandy (careful of spattering!) and whisk to combine. Add the powdered sugar 1/4 cup at a time whisking until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the warm scones and allow to cool to room temp.  Enjoy!,-,/r/food/comments/uuxo34/homemade_pumpkin_cranberry_pecan_scones_with/i9i094s/'

i9il7cw,2022-05-21 18:42:26,Big_Chungus4200,uuv8as,[Homemade] Breakfast Italian sausage apple smoked bacon eggs waffles with strawberry compote and a hash brown,Uhh.. what? I mean we call it that just because thats what its called. We dont all individually wake up and decide to describe them as Italian Sausages. Off the top of my head if Im eating Italian Sausages Im going to expect some vast array of seasonings like basil or maybe fennel etc. and a noticeable casing holding what is most likely pork unless otherwise noted.   Same thing with swiss cheese or french toast. America is a massive melting pot with cultural influence from all over the world. So its a word in my language that is used in my country through the lens of my cultural perspective to convey specific meaning. Thats what its called. It doesnt matter what kind of or how many sausages in Italy they make. I mean dude half the world calls what the US calls French fries Belgian fries.   You can theory whatever you want and trace back etymology and debate cultural appropriation but at the end of the day if you go to a Waffle House and ask for eggy bread with a side of bangers theyre gonna have a conniption and youre probably not gonna get your breakfast.  Language lives and breathes through use and communication. Nothing else matters.   I mean man I understand where youre coming from but this is a weird thing to call out Americans for when its literally just a function of natural language and communication - see Chinese people calling apps A-P-Ps Korean people calling corn dogs hot dogs... I could go on.  Imo you totally could have posed this as an open ended question about American food instead of observing an entire culture top-down and just telling us it doesnt make any sense when there is a clear reason why this happens.,i9i8bii,/r/food/comments/uuv8as/homemade_breakfast_italian_sausage_apple_smoked/i9il7cw/'

I apologize for being stern I have to say it probably comes from a place of exhaustion towards the US being such a punching bag on the internet (although definitely not the only one and definitely at times justifiably so - everyone should be called out when necessary).   Every day you see things like Americans always do this Americans think this when its just as different to the rest of the world as any given culture. It wears me down after a while to see people judge me so harshly on unfounded pretense.  I think discussions like these are good ones to have. Like what you mentioned - about all the posts being American posts. Ive actually seen this sentiment a lot on the internet and I kind of agree and understand it honestly - and I can see why that would be annoying or disheartening.   Much like how communication is important in a romantic relationship I think conversations like these allow us to understand the rest of the world and their point of view.

i9if83h,2022-05-21 17:48:51,murdza,uuulfr,[Homemade] Hickory smoked Texas style brisket,Trimmed brisket leaving about a quarter inch fat cap. Trimmed out any hard fat.   Simple fresh ground pepper and kosher salt rub.  Throw onto cold pellet grill with water tray above heat source. Point facing heat source. Fat side up.  Smoke at 225 until 165 internal temp. Wrap in butcher paper that it spritzed with Apple cider vinegar.   Smoke at 225 until 205 internal temp.   Wrap in towels throw in cooler. Pour boiling water onto towels until towels are saturated.  Rest for minimum one hour.   Enjoy.   I‚Äôm still learning and trying to perfect the technique. For this cook I misjudged the timing and had to rest for six hours in the cooler before guests arrived. Surprisingly I don‚Äôt think this was an issue. The flat came out a bit dry. I think next time I will try to rotate during the cook to allow the flat and point to have equal cooking times closer to heat source. That and Al try to work on timing.,i9ibpry,/r/food/comments/uuulfr/homemade_hickory_smoked_texas_style_brisket/i9if83h/'

i9ht03t,2022-05-21 14:31:29,papulako,uuu2tg,[homemade] Salmon with shrimp sauce,I do this by heart but I can share my tips  I oven bake the salmon with whatever seasoning I feel like trying that day (15-20 mins at 190¬∞c)  for the sauce I sautee onion in butter and then I add the shrimp until it gets a bit of color follow that with a bit of white wine and turn the heat up for about 5 mins then add milk (as much as you want) season the whole thing with sweet paprika and whatever other spices you feel like using! this time I added the zest and juice of a small lemon to give it a cool flavor. Always check for salr and pepper I prefer it to taste both just a bit.   For thickener you can use flour which is the best option but since i had to do this gluten free I used cornstarch  Enjoy!,i9hql7t,/r/food/comments/uuu2tg/homemade_salmon_with_shrimp_sauce/i9ht03t/'

i9h9dcs,2022-05-21 11:49:05,straight_tooken,uut6fa,[homemade] Caldo Verde,Im trying to cook through the Americas Test Kitchen 20th Anniversary Cookbook and finally started taking pictures. Ive done all the breakfasts several soups a pie or two some cookies and a few salads.  Today I made the caldo verde which is a pretty filling soup of potato sausage and veggies.  Paraphrased recipe from the cookbook:  Cook 3/4 lb chorizo cut into 1/2 inch pieces in a Dutch oven with TBSP olive oil for 4-5 minutes of medium high heat. Set chorizo aside then cook a chopped onion 4 minced garlic cloves 1.25 tsp salt .25 tsp red pepper flakes and pepper to taste in the same Dutch oven for 3 minutes of medium heat. Add 2 lbs chopped potato and a quart each of chicken broth and water bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.  Put 3/4 cup of the solids and 3/4 cup of the broth in a blender with 3 TBSP olive oil and puree.  In the Dutch oven add lb of cut collard greens simmer for 10 minutes add the chorizo back simmer for another 10.

i9hjun7,2022-05-21 13:14:45,SirBoiledOrange,uuszww,[Homemade] Salad made by one of my family members.,Yeah I personally love ranch it went well with the strawberries but I try to get a little bit of every ingredient in everh bite too so all the flavor mixes and when you do that the strawberries are just a little sweet taste in the back if you get what Im saying. The chicken was what had the most flavor over everything. There was a lot of stuff in it mainly underneath like there was a beet some peppers tomatos olives pecans and obviously chicken. What js usually just lettuce in my experience was like a mix of a bunch of different plants not sure what kind tbh but yeah you get the point the other flavors kind of mash together and the ranch and strawberries were lighter in flavor that most of the other ingredients. The chicken and pepper was what had the most flavor in the mix. The salad was amazing. It was also my first salad with berries so it seemed weird but ended good.

i9icdpq,2022-05-21 17:22:57,rouxedcadaver,uurzjg,[Homemade] Detroit Style Pizzas,Both are pan pizzas but have some major differences in construction. Detroit style is square all of the toppings are on top of a somewhat thick focaccia-ish base the sauce and cheese are often(but not always) placed on the pizza in lines the pizza uses brick cheese(super important) and the cheese ideally touches the pan to get nice and crispy. Chicago has two main styles of pizza but the most well known is deep dish. Chicago deep dish pizza uses mozzarella is round has a buttery crust with high sides that almost has a biscuit/pastry like quality imo and many will have the cheese on the bottom leaving the sauce on top.,i9h3e92,/r/food/comments/uurzjg/homemade_detroit_style_pizzas/i9icdpq/'

Tasted great today as leftovers as we made waaay too much.,-,/r/food/comments/uuqmk4/homemade_steak/i9i2q00/'

i9i109l,2022-05-21 15:40:35,roboGnomie,uuoz1h,[Homemade] Campfire Steaks,The taste and texture of beef can change drastically depending on how long and at what temperature it is cooked.  When a steak is cooked beyond a certain point (no longer pink) there is a greater chance it will be dry and it will certainly taste quiet different.    Thats the reasoning behind raw beef items.  Dishes like steak tartar and beef sashimi are great examples of the extreme application of this principle.  Certain cultures have a tradition of only cooking meat well done and so consuming raw beef can be very off-putting if its something youve never experienced.  In my opinion what matters most is that you enjoy it so eat things that you like =D,i9hzcpb,/r/food/comments/uuoz1h/homemade_campfire_steaks/i9i109l/'
i9i3teo,2022-05-21 16:05:08,EnderSavesTheDay,uuoz1h,[Homemade] Campfire Steaks,Theres nothing raw about whats in OPs photo.  Raw is actually a darker/bluer color.  A well cooked well rested medium rare steak has the best tenderness and flavor in steaks especially for cut like ribeye.    If you like a tougher well done steak then Id suggest skirt or flank which is typically thinner.  Just for Gods sake rest your meat before you cut into it.,i9hzcpb,/r/food/comments/uuoz1h/homemade_campfire_steaks/i9i3teo/'

i9ifcrx,2022-05-21 17:50:02,its_justme,uuoz1h,[Homemade] Campfire Steaks,Cooking to the right temperature releases the juices and adds appropriate texture. A blue/rare steak is very different than a well done one. That is why the vast majority lean to medium-rare/medium.   I‚Äôve heard in America you can get burgers on the rare side but that‚Äôs just a recipe for salmonella. Ground meat is not the same as a sealed whole piece of meat.,i9hzcpb,/r/food/comments/uuoz1h/homemade_campfire_steaks/i9ifcrx/'

Obs: Whenever I use a fatty cheese in bread. I froze the cheese before adding to the dough. I eases on the shaping and manipulation of the dough.

Vietnamese use plenty of cilantro in other dishes but not to wilt in a soup. Lime is a garnish with bean sprouts and basil adding it to the broth while cooking dulls it.  Also completely missing fish sauce roasted ginger and cardamom pods. Uncle Roger would not approve without msg.  This is a Jaime Oliver version not even Gordon Ramsay.

i9g2i78,2022-05-21 06:10:31,ambo_51,uums50,[Homemade] beef Stroganoff,It was my first time cutting my own steak fillets. I cut them an inch and a half but they need about 2 inches. The cooking process is reverse seared. Salt the steak before putting it into the oven. 10 minutes in the oven. Get a good cast iron skillet and get it as hot as you can on the stove. Add pepper before you slap the steak on the pan about 40 seconds each side. Pan off the heat to where itll only melt butter. Knob of Butter thyme and garlic in the pan and base for a min each side. As for the sauce. Chop onions mushrooms and garlic to see how you like them. Caramelise the onions. Drop the heat to then sweat the onions with paprika and tomato paste. Add your mushrooms and sweat out the water from them to dry-ish. Deglaze with Cognac cook off the alcohol (reduce by half-ish). Pour the cognac onto the pan rather than on top of the food the mushroom will want to absorb the alcohol and give it a bitter taste. Add sour cream whole grain mustard half a lemon juice and beef stock pot. Season to your liking small amount of salt(theres already a lot of salty things in there) and a butt tonne of pepper. Add the pasta water at the end to the viscosity you like. Chop up some parsley and add with the pasta.

i9g34a6,2022-05-21 06:16:19,alexandercecil,uumlnf,[Homemade] Poke bowls for the family,Poke bowls are a great choice in my house of picky eaters because everyone can customize their own dish. For ingredients we had salmon poke asazuke cucumbers edamame brined red bell peppers mango strawberry kiwi crispy salmon skin green onions sesame seeds and Sriracha mayonnaise. Everything is served in bowls on the table and people pass and pick what they want.  Tuna is more traditional for poke but salmon was on sale this week. This   **Salmon poke**  * 2 lbs. salmon fillet skin removed cubed * 1/2 cup soy sauce * 3/4 cup chopped green onions * 2 Tbsp. finely chopped macadamia nuts * 2 Tbsb. sesame oil   1. Combine ingredients in a nonreactive bowl or zipper bag 2. Let marinade for 2-6 hours  **Asazuke cucumbers**  * 2 seedless hot house cucumbers * 1/2 tsp. kosher salt * 2 Tbsp. soy sauce * 1 Tbsp. sesame oil * 1/4 tsp. la-yu (chili oil) * 1/2 tsp. sugar   1. Peel strips of skin from the cucumbers while leaving stripes of skin behind for decoration 2. Cut the cucumbers rangiri style (look it up - it is an easy technique) 3. Mix salt with cucumbers on the cutting board and let sit 5 minutes 4. Rinse and pat dry cucumbers 5. Combine cucumbers and all remaining ingredients in a nonreactive bowl or zipper bag 6. Let marinade for 6+ hours  Edit: apologies if the recipes are not formatted well.

i9fvfkz,2022-05-21 04:57:09,theflavorlab1,uuk8jc,[Homemade] Canolli,The recipe can be found [https://egawd.com/experiment-75-canolli/](https://egawd.com/experiment-75-canolli/)  Sorry for the crappy formatting not sure why it output it all mashed up   You need :¬† shell 	‚Ä¢	~90ml* marsala wine OR white wine OR white grape juice ( for a non-alcohol version ) 	‚Ä¢	250g flour 	‚Ä¢	2 eggs separated 	‚Ä¢	30g butter chopped into small pieces 	‚Ä¢	~1L peanut oil for frying 	‚Ä¢	pinch salt 	‚Ä¢	pinch ground cinnamon 	‚Ä¢	20g icing sugar *You may need a few extra tablespoons**If you have white wine vinegar add 1tsp in the dough ( when adding the wine)¬† it will make the shell even crispier filling 	‚Ä¢	190g ricotta cheese drained overnight 	‚Ä¢	190g mascarpone 	‚Ä¢	30-40g icing sugar ( depends if you like it very sweet or not) 	‚Ä¢	dash of vanilla extract 	‚Ä¢	(optional) pinch cinnamon zest from orange/lemon dash grand Marnier etc  Instructions 	1	Use a spatula and combine all the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours. When ready to fill your shells load a pastry bag and pipe each shell.¬† 	2	Now while the filling is cooling let‚Äôs start on the shells. Using either a stand mixer or food processor stir the flour sugar salt cinnamon together then combine with the butter. Add in your liquid ( wine or juice and the egg yolks ) and mix it together with your hands. Knead the dough for a few minutes(5-7 minutes) you want a smooth texture. Shape it into a ball or disc cover it in plastic film and let it rest 60-90 minutes at room temperature. 	3	Heat up the oil in a pot to 360-375F. While it‚Äôs heat it‚Äôs time to press and shape the dough. If you don‚Äôt have a lot of space to work with chop the dough in half lightly flour your work surface and roll it down using a rolling pin. You want to press it down very thin ( 1/8‚Ä≥) then using a round cookie cutter or a large glass (about 4‚Ä≥ diameter) just punch some hole in the dough. Note you re-roll leftover and cut some more pieces just reform a ball and let it rest a few minutes. 	4	Using a cannoli tube or dowel wrap one round dough around it. To seal it brush some egg white and flap the remaining portion. You can then throw them in the hot oil to fry for 2-3 minutes. You want a nice golden brown coloration.¬† Carefully remove from hot oil and let it sit on parchment paper to cool. I only have 4 cannoli tubes so I fry 2 at a time when I‚Äôm done with the second batch the first batch had time to cool and I can carefully remove the tube and repeat for another dough. 	5	Once the shells are fully cooled simply fill with the mascarpone/ricotta mix dust some icing sugar and enjoy.,-,/r/food/comments/uuk8jc/homemade_canolli/i9fvfkz/'

i9huzhy,2022-05-21 14:48:38,Cakelover9000,uuiyng,[homemade] 3rd attempt at a fraisier cake!,You dont really need a high mold. If you sacrifice the whole strawberries and dice them into the cream that could help. And at the second attempt maybe the whipping cream was  not frigde cold when whipped or you added mascarpone (that can make creams liquid as well).,i9fi33s,/r/food/comments/uuiyng/homemade_3rd_attempt_at_a_fraisier_cake/i9huzhy/'
i9idub9,2022-05-21 17:36:18,lileevine,uuiyng,[homemade] 3rd attempt at a fraisier cake!,Oh I know. Dont worry I did a lot of research into what went wrong every time haha. I will say the previous iterations were made at a family summer home where theres outdated material Im unfamiliar with (including a handmixer with plastic whisk attachments which I didnt even know was a thing before) while this one was made at home where I know the kitchen and its utensils well. That probably contributed to my success.   Dicing is more or less what I ended up doing with the first cake but I do think a huge appeal of the fraisier is the clean aesthetically pleasing cuts with the strawberries standing up and the cream snugly fit in between. It also had a couple other errors like the g√©noise being flat and dense which is a problem that stubbornly still refuses to go away.   My second attempt used cr√®me diplomate which is the partially whipped cream one but it seemed like the problem was mostly that I couldnt fold the cream gently enough to keep shape. I made two cr√®mes one with handwhipped cream which wouldnt even whip properly after an hour and one with canned whipped cream which deflated very quickly. Both were straight out of the fridge cold but it of course happened to be a particularly warm muggy day and even the sugar paste on top pretty much started running and melting the second it was out...  Even this one has a lot of issues I want to work on rectifying. My g√©noise is still a disaster but its on me this time I decided to be a smart ass and bite off more than I could chew when making it by not fully following a recipe. That means a g√©noise that didnt rise at all was quite dense and also was uneven and bumpy on top. I used a mousseline cream this time with butter which held up beautifully but imo I prefer a diplomat tastewise because I find it to be lighter and especially since its a summer cake it matches better.   Anyways!! Im really sorry for typing so much but Ive just been so invested in this cake and trying to do right by it. I think its absolutely wonderful but especially since I really only make it once or twice a year I dont get a ton of practice on it. Its a favourite in my household and although my parents have always been very kind and praised the cakes I want to be able to make one Im really proud of!,i9huzhy,/r/food/comments/uuiyng/homemade_3rd_attempt_at_a_fraisier_cake/i9idub9/'

I also used fresh clams which I cooked separately and added in the last minutes of cooking. Also no bacon to be found where I am in Italy so I used pancetta. I cooked the onion and pancetta and other veggies with some butter and a splash of white wine.   I omitted the cooking sherry worchestershire and Tobasco.   It was other-worldy and really brought back memories of Phils Fish Market in Moss Landing CA.  So gooood,-,/r/food/comments/uuhwnw/homemade_san_francisco_clam_chowder/i9ff4j6/'

The harmony of the soup the quality of the ingredients and the delicate flavor of smoke came together in a cacophony of vague familiarity and absolute cohesiveness. Im not going to wax further but I did so to express how much I enjoyed this bowl. . . Ive made smoked shio before. It was after feedback and reflection intensely too smokey too salty and generally shitty. This bowl arose like a proverbial phoenix newly alit by the wonder of clear dashi shoyu. I know I said I wouldnt wax anymore but I was truly inspired by this shoyu. Fundodai Goyos clear dashi shoyu is fucking awesome and it got me thinking about double soup. . . For some serendipitous reason I recalled Bentons bacon and my first attempt at David Changs bacon dashi. This attempt was much more precise thanks to a variable heat induction burner and again the quality of the bacon and kombu(I used Konbu Doi Ninen Yoshoku Makonbu from The Japanese Pantry). I loved the delicate flavor of this dashi and paired with a super gentle pork chintan it just was wonderful. Fat from rendering Bentons bacon went into the bottom of the bowl and garlic oil floated on top. . . I dry brined a rolled pork shoulder in equal parts sugar and salt over night before smoking at around 205¬∞ for about 8 hours. I then marinated the roll in soy sake and mirin before slicing. It obviously complimented the smoke elements of the bowl. Other toppings were just ajitama negi and menma.  . . Noodles were just the rye noodles I posted previously which if I had to pick something I would exchange for a slippery bitey noodle. I cannot express how much I loved this bowl. I likely would never offer this bowl in a kit given the price of ingredients but if I were to cater small ramen nights *wink* I reckon I could.,-,/r/food/comments/uueqs7/smoked_shoyu_ramen_ÈÜ§Ê≤π„É©„É°„Éº„É≥_homemade/i9etoen/'

i9eojv3,2022-05-20 19:47:20,Wafafawey,uucspj,[I ate] garlic ice cream,Im sure many people know this already but since I couldnt see anyone else explaining for those that dont-  Black garlic is essentially whole garlic that has been very gently heated for a few weeks allowing the Maillard reaction to kinda do its thing for an extended period of time without burning or drying out.  It is left with none of the acridity of raw garlic and a very rich sweet flavour.  My best way to describe for someone who hasnt had it is to imagine the difference between raw onion and onions that have been slowly and gently caramelised and then extrapolate that tenfold.,-,/r/food/comments/uucspj/i_ate_garlic_ice_cream/i9eojv3/'

I bet it‚Äôs the difference between fresh and roasted. I‚Äôm immune to roasted I can pop em like peanuts. Fresh is a different story it overwhelms everything. So to me roasted would fit better in this delicate culinary situation. Add it al up a slightly garlicky nose a creamy and mildly umami middle and a sweet and somewhat garlicky finish. Yeah that‚Äôs weird because the garlic and sweet follows you along for the whole ride.,i9egwik,/r/food/comments/uucspj/i_ate_garlic_ice_cream/i9eikyn/'

It started mellow and mostly vanilla. Then the garlic flavor really bumped up. Then the garlic flavor was in my nose. I couldnt get over it. I didnt have a second bite of it.

In contrast the changes in the color and flavor that occur in white garlic in order to make black garlic are all due to the Maillard reaction.  https://www.simplyrecipes.com/what-is-black-garlic-and-how-is-it-used-5186520,i9g05qe,/r/food/comments/uucspj/i_ate_garlic_ice_cream/i9g0idz/'

i9g2ku1,2022-05-21 06:11:12,Jmsaint,uucspj,[I ate] garlic ice cream,The abstract misuses the term fermentation and later in the article it makes a distinction between black garlic and a separate yeast-fermented variant on black garlic:  As we mentioned in the previous section the quality of BG including its bioactivity and texture depends on the temperature during thermal processing. However according to the discovery of Jung et¬†al¬†[25] fermented BG displays more effective bioactivity than ABG. In this section we will summarize the quality of fermented BG and its potentials against several kinds of diseases.  See this reference: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027153171100087X   Normal black garlic is not fermented. There is a yeast fermented variant. There is definitely not  bacterial fermentation in the normal process which is driven by maillard reactions.,i9g1q9r,/r/food/comments/uucspj/i_ate_garlic_ice_cream/i9g2ku1/'

i9g2v9t,2022-05-21 06:13:57,TheJeezeus,uucspj,[I ate] garlic ice cream,Saying that its cooked and not fermented is like adding boiling water to yeast to activate it. The temperature and humidity level are the most important factor here to keep the bacteria alive. Without the bacteria the process doesnt happen and you get burnt garlic. Im making some in my garage right now. Ill continue to do the correct fermentation process rather than ruin it with your ignorant incorrect information.,i9g2ku1,/r/food/comments/uucspj/i_ate_garlic_ice_cream/i9g2v9t/'

Im normally pretty meh when I see pro / chef posts but this looks extremely great.   My only gripe is the meat sitting on the slices of bread. I know you were going for presentation but if I was a guest I wouldnt like that the bread soaked up the oils and grease from the meat. Not that I would complain though.

i9g2uun,2022-05-21 06:13:50,TheLadyEve,uubp1i,[Pro/Chef] Texas Barbecue & Burgers,Post oak or pecan wood are fairly common here. Fruit woods for stuff like turkey and pork butt.,i9fajcm,/r/food/comments/uubp1i/prochef_texas_barbecue_burgers/i9g2uun/'
i9fbmlo,2022-05-21 00:09:04,shikuto,uubp1i,[Pro/Chef] Texas Barbecue & Burgers,Yes post oak is what I‚Äôm referring to. I asked one specific person and was refraining from noting the variety until they had responded but you‚Äôve forced my hand here.   I‚Äôm quite aware of the ability to get post oak from Amazon^[1] - I now live in Utah and that‚Äôs about the only way I can get my hands on it. The point I was making is that it is pretty essential to making what many **many** people consider authentic Texas BBQ. The fact that the first two species you mentioned *weren‚Äôt* post oak exemplifies that it‚Äôs possible likely even that the user I initially questioned didn‚Äôt use post oak.   The user I responded to asked if there was something that made the smoke in Texas magical and the ‚Äútrue answer‚Äù would be no but the answer I thought they might appreciate is ‚Äúthe wood.‚Äù Which is true. Traditional Texas style BBQ generally uses post oak largely because it grows in massive swaths there.   You know what grows plentifully in California and contributes greatly to the Santa Maria style BBQ? Red Oak/Coast Live Oak. It‚Äôs still oak. The meat most commonly associated with it (tri tip) is incredibly similar to brisket and can often be substituted for it. The seasonings are salt pepper and garlic (which is debatably associated with Texas BBQ as well though more often than not it‚Äôs just the Dalmatian seasoning.) That leaves the wood as the only big deciding factor in differentiating the two styles - if only looking at the meat.   ^[1] Can you stop contesting claims I never made now? I‚Äôll refer once again to the comment I originally made:  >I‚Äôm not saying it can only be had in Texas‚Ä¶,i9fajcm,/r/food/comments/uubp1i/prochef_texas_barbecue_burgers/i9fbmlo/'

i9fe17b,2022-05-21 00:44:37,caldera,uubp1i,[Pro/Chef] Texas Barbecue & Burgers,You‚Äôve spent so much time on oak when it‚Äôs fucking mesquite and hickory and oak if it‚Äôs lying around. Wtf.

i9fccar,2022-05-21 00:19:28,Sun_Beams,uubp1i,[Pro/Chef] Texas Barbecue & Burgers,But the official BBQ wood for Texas is Mesquite then Hickory. Its pretty regional even in Texas so wouldnt the wood be a moot point if you can get all three internationally anyway?  >Is there something magical about the atmosphere in Texas that makes for the best tasting smoke?  You propositioned that wood was the answer but the wood isnt just found in Texas.

i9g6t8t,2022-05-21 06:49:28,TheLadyEve,uubp1i,[Pro/Chef] Texas Barbecue & Burgers,I know were known for brisket but I tend to judge a place on the sausage.

i9felxu,2022-05-21 00:53:19,shikuto,uubp1i,[Pro/Chef] Texas Barbecue & Burgers,>Wtf. What kind of wood chips do you think soak in water for the smoker?  None at least not on my lands. Soaking wood before smoking is unnecessary. For one the wood isn‚Äôt liable to pick up much moisture (in terms of what it could) in an hour soak. Secondly why in the actual fuck would you want to wet your wood? You spend several months letting it dry out to a proper humidity level only to undo that time? **Why?**  Thirdly and this is perhaps the most important part: soaking your wood chips doesn‚Äôt help smoke production. Just because you see shit coming out of the smokestack doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs smoke. You aware what water turns into when it is heated? **Steam.** You know what looks an awful lot like smoke when exiting a smokestack? *Steam.* The process **might** extend smoke time on chips but if the smoke is lower in proportion why do it?   Why use chips even? I‚Äôd rather keep a nice clean burning fire with logs. Dampers on the smokestack/intake are for the weak. Proper fire management and plenty of airflow is all you need. And I would bet a kidney that 99/100 of the top pit masters in the world would agree with me.   So sure I‚Äôd take your cook off challenge.

i9fd862,2022-05-21 00:32:31,shikuto,uubp1i,[Pro/Chef] Texas Barbecue & Burgers,My proposition was that wood was the answer yes. The other part of the proposition that you‚Äôve ignored in its entirety for the duration of this conversation is that it‚Äôs quite likely that the user I was questioning who **is not** the same user I responded to didn‚Äôt use the woods either of us have in mind.   I‚Äôm seeing mesquite as the ‚Äúofficial wood of Texas‚Äù with a quick online search but I‚Äôm having a tough time reconciling that with my (admittedly anecdotal) experience of having BBQ all over Texas. I could be totally off base here but it‚Äôs all kinda ancillary to the point which was ultimately: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the magic ingredient to TX BBQ smoke.‚Äù The answer is: the wood.   No there‚Äôs nothing stopping anyone from making authentic TX BBQ in fucking Antarctica for all I care so long as they‚Äôre following genuine recipes and procedures. People using a mustard binder aren‚Äôt doing Texas BBQ. People coating the exterior of their meat with brown sugar (no matter how delicious) aren‚Äôt doing Texas BBQ. BBQing a whole hog is a Carolina thing not Texas.

i9easr3,2022-05-20 17:45:35,QuetzalzGreen85,uuag9b,[Homemade] Pot Roast with Potatoes Carrots and Homemade Gravy,Recipe  - 3+ lb beef chuck roast (mine was around 3.27 lbs)   - oil (I used grapeseed)      - 1 teaspoon salt   - 1 teaspoon onion powder (I use less since I don‚Äôt like onion)   - 1 teaspoon garlic powder (I use more since I love garlic)    - 1 teaspoon black pepper (I use more since I love black pepper)   - 1 teaspoon black garlic salt (optional)   - 1 teaspoon Worcestershire powder (optional)   - 1 teaspoon minced garlic (optional)   - 1 lb baby potatoes (I use more since I love potatoes)   - 4 large carrots peeled and chopped into chunks (I used about 8 since I had smaller carrots)      - 4 cups beef broth or stock   - 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce   - 1/4 cup water (I use the liquid from the Instant Pot instead of water)   - 2 tablespoons corn starch   1. Set the Instant Pot to the saut√© function. In a bowl mix together the salt onion powder garlic powder black pepper black garlic salt Worcestershire powder and minced garlic. Rub the mixture on the roast (I add the seasonings to a bottle and sprinkle on).   2. Drizzle the oil in the Instant Pot wait for the pot to get warm (about 30 seconds) then add the roast.   3. Let the roast brown for 3-4 minutes then turn over and brown for 3-4 minutes.   4. Switch the Instant Pot to Pressure Cook on high and set to 60 minutes for a 3 lb roast 70 minutes for a 4 lb roast or 80 minutes for a 5 lb roast (I set mine to 65 minutes for a 3.27 lb roast).   5. Add the whole baby potatoes and chunks of carrots (either on the sides of the roast or on top). Add the Worcestershire sauce and broth/stock. Place the lid on the Instant Pot lock and set the valve to seal (mine does this automatically).   6. When the Instant Pot finishes cooking let it naturally release for 10 minutes then do a quick release.   7. Transfer the roast potatoes and carrots to a dish and use forks to shred the meat.   8. Set the Instant Pot to the Soup function. Whisk together the water/liquid from pot roast and corn starch. Once the liquid in the Instant Pot is boiling stir in the corn starch mixture until the gravy thickens. I usually add more corn starch as needed (mixing it in with some gravy from the Instant Pot). Add additional seasonings as needed.   9. Serve the gravy with the pot roast potatoes and carrots.  You can add other veggies if you wish like mushrooms and onions.    You can strain the gravy if you want but I prefer mine to have little bits of potato and carrot in it. There will be a lot of excess gravy so I like taking leftovers and making hot pot roast sandwiches.    Edited to add the additional optional ingredients I use.,-,/r/food/comments/uuag9b/homemade_pot_roast_with_potatoes_carrots_and/i9easr3/'

i9dwe6q,2022-05-20 15:41:47,Adequateblogger,uu9lu8,[Homemade] Tikka Pizza Detroit style.,This was really good! It works well because of the tomato base that chicken tikka masala uses. I used a jar simmer sauce (albeit expensive af but good) rather than homemade tonight because I was also testing out some grandma-style pies so no recipe for that part of it. I simmered the chicken down in the sauce until it was thicker which resulted in the color looking a bit more like a garam masala. Mix of brick white cheddar and mozz on the pizza.  Here is my Detroit style pizza recipe that I used (then topped with tikka + cilantro) but I also [wrote more about making DSP](https://palapizza.com/how-to-make-detroit-style-pizza-at-home/) here which goes into more depth for those who are interested.  **Equipment**  1 10x14 Detroit Style Steel Pan. I used a Lloyds Pan and love it.  **Ingredients**  \- Dough  350 g Bread Flour  255 g Water (warmed to 90¬∞F)  10 g Kosher Salt  3.5 g Instant Dried Yeast  \- Toppings  Low Moisture Whole Milk Mozzarella Shredded or cubed  Wisconsin Brick Cheese Cubed. Substitute with white cheddar pepper jack or havarti.  **Instructions**  \- Make the dough.  1. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir to combine. 2. Heat water in microwavable safe bowl for 30 seconds. Temperature should be between 85F and 95F. Add yeast to water and let sit for 5 minutes. Were not looking for a full activation just a bit of a jumpstart. 3. Slowly add water/yeast mixture to the stand mixer mixing on low until it forms a smooth consistency about 10 minutes. Note: dough will be very wet and sticky and the bottom will stick to the bowl. 4. With the dough still in mixer bowl fold into a ball cover with plastic wrap and set on counter for 1 ‚Äì 2 hours to kick-start fermentation. You should notice some rise in the dough but not doubling in volume. 5. Place in refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.  **Stretch dough in pan.**  1. Let dough come to room temperature on the counter for 3 hours. 2. Preheat the oven to 550¬∞F. If using an Ooni or other outdoor pizza oven preheat until 700-800 degrees about 20 minutes. 3. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and into the pan. Because of the high hydration in this recipe you may need to wet your hands prior to handling. Flatten and stretch the dough to fit the pan as close as possible (a tiny bit of shrinking may happen thats fine). Let sit for ¬Ω hour then stretch again ensuring dough touches edges of pan. 4. Place pan on the bottom of your oven to par-bake the dough for 5 minutes.  **Toppings in order then bake.**  1. Carefully remove the hot pan from oven. Add shredded mozzarella then cubed brick cheese ensuring cheese touches the edge of the pan. 2. For home ovens: place pizza in oven for another 7 minutes on the bottom rack. (toss the broiler on for the final minute or two if the cheese and pepperoni is not browning fast enough). 3. For outdoor pizza ovens: bake for 5 minutes rotating pan halfway through. 4. Remove from oven and use a metal spatula to separate the pizza from the pan. Slide onto a wire rack to rest for 3 minutes.,-,/r/food/comments/uu9lu8/homemade_tikka_pizza_detroit_style/i9dwe6q/'

If you were on a date and your date either asked or answered affirmatively to the question of is cereal a soup? would you either A) lunge across the table and beat the shit out of them or B) pretend to receive an emergency phone call and then abscond out the bathroom window due to their apparent mental illness?

i9bi9z8,2022-05-20 05:13:59,judgingyouquietly,uttp7n,[I ate] Shawarma Poutine,The city of Ottawa (Canadas national capital) is known for shawarma thanks to its big Lebanese and other Middle Eastern populations.  Its also on the border with Quebec so proper poutine (with the squeaky cheese curds) is a big thing as well.  When I ordered a poutine at a well-known shawarma shop they asked if I wanted any toppings on it.  Here was the exchange:     Me:  Yes...all of them  Cook:  ...all of them?  Me:  All of them  Cook:  ...I dont think Ill be able to close the top  Me:  Thats fine.  &#x200B  That combination was one of the best poutines Ive ever had.  The toum with the poutine gravy the beef with the fries and cheese the pickles with everything...*chefs kiss*  Also he misheard and doubled the toum so I have a 500m anti-vampire bubble around me.

I concede if you eat it right away you aren‚Äôt gonna get as much of a soggy fry. I personally still don‚Äôt like the condiment seeping into the fries I‚Äôd rather dip. I kind of disagree that it takes that amount of time for a fry to absorb condiment on it as well 10 mins is quite a while.

This restaurant is at about 41.85¬∞ N which puts it about a mile south of the California border.  The point still stands though.

i9ekkd7,2022-05-20 19:11:15,momomoca,utr520,[I ate] The Fries Box,Its not really accurate to say that keto isnt harmful though-- [heres an article from Harvard Med covering the basics](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-try-the-keto-diet). It can exacerbate existing health issues one might not even be aware of assuming keto is done without consulting a RD or just worsen your health in general because youre forcing your body into ketosis. There are other diets that are less risky than keto but in general its best to alter your eating habits in a sustainable manner so the weight loss actually lasts. I acknowledge that some people use these diets to rapidly lose weight as sort of a running start but unless this is done under the supervision of a RD with a plan to transition into a more sustainable way of eating after a certain milestone is reached then the effects of this start are unlikely to be beneficial in the long run.,i9dkwgv,/r/food/comments/utr520/i_ate_the_fries_box/i9ekkd7/'
i9g77oo,2022-05-21 06:52:51,Competitive_Tap4956,utr520,[I ate] The Fries Box,Exactly. I still get around 75g carbs a day which is much less than a typical western diet but not enough for me to be lethargic and have no energy all the time. I cut out all sodas and processed foods. I basically eat a lot of meat non starchy veggies and some fruit. I reserve my meals with the most carbs for before my workouts and I usually incorporate a complex carb like a sweet potato. All of this helps me reach my caloric deficit goal of 750 calories so I lose about a pound and a half a week. I get about 250g of protein a day to minimize muscle loss while in a deficit and lifting.,i9dkwgv,/r/food/comments/utr520/i_ate_the_fries_box/i9g77oo/'

Now that I live in New Brunswick my partner and I do the same thing except with PEI and Nova Scotia not far away (were in Moncton) we can easily do day trips there as well.

It has one of the largest Mexican population in Canada. The Main Street of the town is full of Mexican variety stores and Mexican restaurants. The whole area is made of completely flat land with farm after farm after farm. There are a lot of migrant workers and many of them became residents. There‚Äôs a lot of Mexican produce grown right here and a lot of Mexican ingredients in the grocery stores. It‚Äôs the same with Jamaican/Caribbean stuff. This made me really happy when I moved here from the Caribbean. The region also has the mildest winter in Canada (besides the Vancouver area) and that‚Äôs actually why I specifically chose to move here instead of let‚Äôs say Montreal.

Food is a business and almost every economic factor in business pushes quality down. Freshness speed of service quality of ingredients difficulty/time of preparation authenticity etc all add to cost in a substantial way. The reason regions are known for food is because the PEOPLE in that region know how it is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to taste because that is how their family and friends and local kitchens make it. To open a restaurant in that area and be successful you have to provide a product that people like and think is reasonably priced. There are plenty of mediocre pizza places in the middle of no-where Kansas that wouldn‚Äôt stay open for a week in little Italy NY. Furthermore the bigger the demand the more restaurants you see with various qualities and techniques and specializations. There are also supply chains issues (the pork used in spaghetti carbonara is wide spread in rome but only available at specialized butchers in the USA. So most Italian joints in the US will just use bacon instead due to costs/availability)   I‚Äôm not saying you won‚Äôt stumble upon a random gem outside of the regions of speciality but it‚Äôs rare. The best gumbo in New York will probably be just be slightly above average one in New Orleans. And an average gumbo in NY will be considered bad in NO.   I used to live near the best French bakery in central texas that local Europeans would drive over an hour one way to go to. But in Paris the same quality could be found within a 5 minute walk for most people.   I don‚Äôt know how else to say it. The local population drives food quality and authenticity through demand and patronization.,i9d2spa,/r/food/comments/utr520/i_ate_the_fries_box/i9duf4i/'

i99s6tt,2022-05-19 17:56:17,abigailgwhitney,uthfis,[Homemade] fettuccine Alfredo.,RECIPE:  Ingredients: -3 tbsp butter -1 tbsp minced garlic  -1.5 tbsp flour -1.5 cups milk -1.5 cups heavy cream -1/4 tsp salt (or to taste) -1/4 tsp pepper (or to taste) -1 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese -Parsley (just for the plating aspect)  Directions: 1. Melt your butter. 2. Add your garlic. 3. Add your flour and mix until combined. 4. Add your milk and heavy cream and bring it to a simmer until it thickens. 5. Add salt and pepper. 6. Slowly add in your Parmesan cheese. 7. Once it melts just pour the sauce over cooked fettuccine noodles sprinkles with parsley if you‚Äôd like to and enjoy!!  Notes: -This is a really simple recipe and it‚Äôs SOOO delicious!! Definitely worth trying out!! -It‚Äôs very rich (with all the cream and milk) so if you don‚Äôt want/can‚Äôt eat food that‚Äôs too heavy then this probably isn‚Äôt for you. -I like to use whole milk real butter and regular all purpose flour. I also like to mince my own garlic. -You need to shred your own cheese for this recipe. I suppose you could use store-bought (already shredded) but there‚Äôs a sort of coating they put on that cheese that makes it harder to melt. I‚Äôm telling you shredding your own block of Parmesan will make all the difference!! -THIS IS NOT MY RECIPE!! I got it originally from tiktok: the account is @mamainthekitchen  I hope you guys enjoy making this recipe!!

i99jphu,2022-05-19 16:44:28,shellzero,utfb3f,[Homemade] Risotto with English pea pur√©e and saut√©ed shiitake mushrooms,Recipe:     Mise en place:   Arborio rice - 1/2 cup   Minced shallots   Minced garlic   Black pepper   Peas   White wine - 1/4 cup   Vegetable stock (Made it from scratch at home pretty straightforward) around 4 cups   Olive oil   Shiitake mushrooms chopped length wise   A sprig of thyme   Salt   Lemon     Take a saucepot and bring the vegetable stock to boil and then keep it on lowest flame possible. Using hot vegetable stock while cooking risotto is a must.     Risotto:   Coat a medium saucepot with olive oil and place on medium-high heat. When the olive oil is hot add the shallots and garlic. Saut√© but do not allow to get brown. Add the rice gently coating them with the contents of the saucepot. Deglaze with white wine. Reduce the wine completely. Once you cannot see any liquid slowly add the vegetable stock to the risotto one ladle at a time stirring constantly. When the rice absorb all the vegetable stock add one more ladle. Repeat until the rice is cooked through creamy with just a little firmness. Season with salt and fresh ground pepper.   Pea puree:    While the risotto cooks make your pea pur√©e. In a small saucepot bring 4 cups of water (and a little salt) to a boil. Remember to stir your risotto while you are making the pea pur√©e. Add in peas boiling them until they float. Then remove and blanch them in ice water so that they keep their green color. Pur√©e the peas in a blender. You can add additional cold water for easier blending. Blend until smooth.   Mushrooms:   In a  saut√© pan heat olive oil to medium high. Add the shiitake mushrooms salt pepper thyme shallots and garlic. Stir. Cook the mushrooms until all the water has evaporated to ensure a concentrated flavor.    Back to risotto:   Now fold a small amount of the pea pur√©e into the risotto. Do this at the last minute to make sure the green color is retained. You can use all the pea pur√©e in the risotto if you like. Its freaking delicious.   Plate and squeeze some lemon juice over the mushrooms. Top risotto with a drizzle of olive oil. Serve :D,-,/r/food/comments/utfb3f/homemade_risotto_with_english_pea_pur√©e_and/i99jphu/'

i9agskd,2022-05-19 21:31:42,aquamanjosh,utemxp,[Homemade] Smoked leg of lamb,We literally do basically this exact prep with our lamb shank at our restaurant. We sous vide them before we freeze them after the marinade. Cold smoke not to over cook with hickory and then fresh tarragon in the lamb sauce we take out of the sous vide bag. Reduced with a little Demi and then coated on the shank after we flash fry it for like 1 minute to get a nice crisp on the fatty skin.  edit: We switch up the sauce all the time mint is high up on the list. Sometimes we incorporate rasp blue black berries with mint for the lamb sauce!,i999trh,/r/food/comments/utemxp/homemade_smoked_leg_of_lamb/i9agskd/'

You are objectively wrong in calling this raw.  Raw would be anything cooked to under 120F/rare.  This roast is well over that mark and crossing into medium territory.

i9baziy,2022-05-20 04:04:43,Rugged_as_fuck,utemxp,[Homemade] Smoked leg of lamb,No it would literally be inedible. It would be tougher than shoe leather and twice as dry. This cut just cant be cooked that way in the same way that you cant throw a chuck roast on the grill at 500 degrees and cook it like a steak. Thats not how that cut is prepared.  If you dont want to eat it like this that just means this cut of meat isnt for you. And thats ok!

Unless you‚Äôre spinning nests for portions you shouldn‚Äôt pile your pasta when you make that much. It‚Äôll cause it to start to stick together!!  Also the pasta looks a bit thick! What size did you roll it on?,i99ald5,/r/food/comments/utelu3/homemade_pasta/i99bf9t/'

i9e9ik6,2022-05-20 17:34:15,Easy-Concentrate2636,utelu3,[homemade] pasta,Interesting about the egg. I saw your other post with the pasta cooked - that‚Äôs what led me here.  I like to toss the pasta with some good salt olive oil fresh ground pepper and saut√©ed king mushrooms.  Some grated parm on top. In all honesty the pasta doesn‚Äôt need much because homemade pasta is so amazing as it is. Ivy also eaten it with just olive oil salt and grated parm - still tremendously satisfying.,i9e8zz5,/r/food/comments/utelu3/homemade_pasta/i9e9ik6/'

i99ebts,2022-05-19 15:59:14,NowhereLad,utcsrq,[Homemade] Sticky Toffee Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream,Sure thing! Here you go..  160g dates chopped 200ml boiling hot tea 1 pinch of bicarb soda 150g dark brown sugar 90g butter 2 eggs 2 tbsp black treacle  1 tsp bicarb soda 175g self raising flour  200g dark brown sugar 80g butter 1 tbsp black treacle Pinch of sea salt 250ml double cream  1. Pour the tea over the dates with a pinch of bicarb and let that sit for 30 minutes  2. Mix the butter and sugar well then add the eggs 1 at a time beating well add the black treacle and beat again.  3. Add the bicarb and half of the flour fold that through and then repeat the process with the remaining flour.  4. Stir through the dates with the liquid to form the batter. Grease a baking tin and pre heat the oven to 150c fan.  5. Pour the batter into the baking tin and bake for 50 mins  6. To make the sauce melt the butter and sugar with the treacle and salt over a medium heat before pouring in the cream and simmering until thick velvety and luxurious   7. Poke a few holes into the cooked pudding pour over a ladle of sauce and return to the oven for a further 5 mins to form a sticky glazed top.  8. Serve with vanilla ice cream or even custard if that‚Äôs your vibe,i9981uw,/r/food/comments/utcsrq/homemade_sticky_toffee_pudding_with_vanilla_ice/i99ebts/'

In two separate small bowls add in 2 tablespoons of flour in each one. Add in 1 tablespoon of butter in each bowl then add in the jello in one and the pudding in the other bowl.      Using a fork mix the content of each bowl until combined and crumbly looking. Pour the strawberry jello streusel on one side of the pan and pour the vanilla streusel on the other.   Bake in the preheated oven for 11 minutes.    Let the streusel cool down completely while making your cookies then gently mix it to get the vanilla and strawberry flavors combined togehter.      **Make the strawberry cake mix cookies**    In a large bowl add the strawberry cake mix flour oil eggs and heavy cream and mix until the dry cake mix disappears.

Tell me you dont know about beef in 8 words or less?  The main use of Angus cattle is for beef production and consumption. The beef can be marketed as superior due to its marbled appearance. This has led to many markets including Australia Japan and the United Kingdom to adopt it into the mainstream...  ..The cattle have a large muscle content and are regarded as medium-sized. The meat is very popular in¬†Japan for its marbling qualities   The shift to primarily Black Angus in the late 1970s came about in part because Black Angus cattle marble extremely well. Since Black Angus as a breed features finely textured marbling its a tried-and-true beautifully marbled¬†beef Biblio:  https://web.archive.org/web/20150624204743/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/beef/breeding/breeds/angus  https://www.crowdcow.com/blog/the-basics-behind-meat-marbling,i9a0396,/r/food/comments/ut9yms/i_ate_angus_flank_steak_with_chimichurri_sauce/i9ebsi3/'

Thats why waffle fries are called what they are because it has the same pattern. Same reason you cant take the same batter and just cook it in a pan and call it a waffle it becomes a pancake.

To get a higher crunchy/seared ratio vs soft dough (depends on which Belgian waffle if its crunchy or not. Liegois vs Brussels vs Laquemans vs...) . Im not sure what happened to these things as theyre so covered in toppings I cant see the actual dough but theres definitely no squares. And it really looks like they were fried which makes them more like smoutebollen (but then I suppose without the tallow). Probably still tasty. Definitely not a waffle.

If you salt the stock first it will be too salty when reduced.

i977lsp,2022-05-19 06:31:25,Ltrly_Htlr,ut3aqj,[homemade] chicken and black bean burrito with sour cream and guacamole,I make it myself without following a recipe but I‚Äôll write it out as best I can:  -	chicken sliced up (whatever your preferred cut is. I use 6 chicken thighs at a time)  -	2 small onions or 1 larger onion diced -	2 peppers sweet and/or hot. Diced  -	1 can of black beans -	seasonings - onion and garlic powder paprika hot chili powder cayenne cumin black pepper and salt. Mixed to taste  -	1 tomato diced -	guacamole -	cheddar cheese grated -	sour cream -	tortillas  Cook sliced chicken in an oiled pan on medium-high heat and try to get some colour on both the chicken and the pan.   Once cooked add the onions and peppers. Sprinkle some salt and sweat them out over medium-high heat for a few minutes  Add the seasoning and your can of beans. Use some of aqua fava to help distribute the seasoning around the contents of the pan and to deglaze any fond that built up   Cook 15-20 minutes over medium-low heat until vegetables have reached desired tenderness and liquid has mostly cooked off.   Serve on warm tortillas with tomatoes onions sour cream guacamole or anything else you enjoy.,-,/r/food/comments/ut3aqj/homemade_chicken_and_black_bean_burrito_with_sour/i977lsp/'

If Im paying that kind of cash Id expect 10oz of beef. Roughly $40 here. Course geographics play a role. Ive never really understood why in the UK you go to a carvery and get a mountain of food yet an upscale resto or great pub is a smaller portion.  That being said. The cook is flawless chips are excellent salad looks great. Sauce on the side is a must(which is usually never done here). Its a great meal reminds me of my time spent working in the UK.

i96qgae,2022-05-19 03:45:02,jasonandhiswords,ut0hr7,[homemade] Pepperoni Pizza,Good morning! I sightly adjusted [this recipe by the king of Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe) to make it.  For anyone thinking about trying it which I highly recommend what I do is follow all the steps right up to putting it in the oven. I salt and garlic powder the crust put a light layer of sauce and cheese avoiding the middle of the pie. This will be about 50% of the total sauce and cheese.   Then I cook it for 10-12 minutes and pull it out. I add the rest of my sauce cheese and other toppings now. If you load it with cheese and wet toppings right from the beginning the middle of the pizza will often be under cooked. I try to partially dry my toppings first. Pop it back in the oven until the cheese looks how you want it usually another 7-9 minutes or so then pull it out,-,/r/food/comments/ut0hr7/homemade_pepperoni_pizza/i96qgae/'

Cast iron pan - get it hot - hot like you!  3. While your waiting make a burger sauce - I like mine wet wet wet so I use pickle juice mayo ketchup yellow mustard diced jalape√±os diced pickles. Also shred some lettuce and from now on call it shrettuce!  4. Toast them buns and set aside  5. Put your balls in the pan (your mince balls - if that needed to be said‚Ä¶) put a square of parchment/baking paper on top and smash them down (I use meat mallet but use whatever!)  6. Peal off the paper and season with S&P. Leave your burgers be for 1 minute we want that crisssppppy caramalised crust!  7. Add a spoon of burger sauce to the patty then flip that sauce will get sooo caramelised! Yum 8. Add cheese to the patties and leave another minute (1 minute each side is all we need!). Then stack one on top of the other and take off the heat. 9. Assembly time! Base bun dollop of sauce shrettuce burger tower sauuuccceeee then crown your king!  10. Enjoy the juiciest burger of your life‚Ä¶ no napkins no bibs no wiping your face half way through‚Ä¶ embrace the JUICEEEEE  Peace!,-,/r/food/comments/uszawd/homemade_smash_burger/i96kd9v/'

i97mgzb,2022-05-19 08:19:17,CorgiSplooting,uszawd,[homemade] Smash Burger.,I made these two days ago for the first time too. I followed Guga Foods recipe from YouTube. It was an extremely juicy‚Ä¶ fast food burger. Would I do it again?  My wife asked me to ‚Äúnever make that again‚Äù‚Ä¶. But that said she ate nearly all of hers. My reaction was less severe but no. I won‚Äôt be making them again. We both like American cheese on ‚Äúsome‚Äù things and I always have them in the fridge but this just covered your mouth in an unpleasant way. I made ramen once where it was suggested to let a slice of American melt into the broth and this was like that. It‚Äôs just a taste that lingers and not something I like.  Honestly the up front taste of the burger was ‚Äúgood‚Äù but the lingering taste that lasted for hours is why I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. Stuffed burgers are slower to make slower to cook but WAY better!  Not knocking if you like it (different people are different and that‚Äôs a good thing) but just setting expectations. I like the recipes I‚Äôve gotten from Guga Foods and his other sous vide channel but not this one.   Another tip though. DO NOT make this inside your house!  The smoke generated was insane. I had to pull my smoke alarm and the smell it left was still there in the morning. (Gone by the afternoon),-,/r/food/comments/uszawd/homemade_smash_burger/i97mgzb/'

i9788cd,2022-05-19 06:36:24,stephen1547,uszawd,[homemade] Smash Burger.,The whole thing is browned so it‚Äôs all one big Maillard reaction which means tones of flavour.  You lose a bit of juiciness since it‚Äôs thin but it‚Äôs a worthwhile sacrifice.  A burger sauce makes up for that part.  In my opinion it‚Äôs the most tasty type of burger.  The fact that they cook in like one minute is a bonus.  I get my pan to about 600¬∞ f when I make them and 30 seconds a side is all they need.  Just gotta unplug the smoke alarm because things are gonna get crazy.  Even with my 1000 CFPM range hood smoke still escapes.,i96u8co,/r/food/comments/uszawd/homemade_smash_burger/i9788cd/'

i97nxab,2022-05-19 08:29:14,CorgiSplooting,uszawd,[homemade] Smash Burger.,The smash burger is all about using American cheese as it melts so quickly into the meat.

It‚Äôs totally worth it to simply try something new.  Edit: if you mean better American cheeses slices‚Ä¶ maybe?

This is definitely not a traditional recipe of any sorts but it‚Äôs one of my favorites.   Saut√© a small onion 2 chopped portobello mushroom and eggplant in olive oil very well and then add jarred sauce (or make your own whatever you like) and simmer for ~15 minutes. Add some garlic.   Separately mix 1/2 cup ricotta 1/2 cup Parmesan 1/8 tsp salt 1/8 tsp pepper 3 tbsp chopped basil and 1 egg (this is from an America‚Äôs test kitchen recipe). Also grate 4oz of fresh mozzarella.   Layer as follows:  ~1/4 cup of sauce noodle 1/3 of ricotta mixture and 1/4 cup of mozzarella. Repeat for two more noodles. Place final noodle on top and cover with remaining sauce mozz and some parm. Bake at 400F covered for ~25 minutes then uncovered for ~10 minutes. Let rest for 20 minutes. Top with some fresh basil. Enjoy!  Also here‚Äôs a side shot.

i95pz0r,2022-05-18 20:08:32,JMetilinos,ussegs,[homemade] Cheese Pizza,Sure.   Dough is entirely eyeballed but:  3/4 cup warm-semi hot water  2 1-4 teaspoons active yeast  Pinch of sugar   3c of bread flour (all purpose is fine)  Pinch of salt and any seasonings you may want in your dough.  Combine the water sugar and yeast and allow ten minutes to become frothy (let‚Äôs you know the yeast is active!). Make a well in a stand mixer bowl with your flour and affix your dough hook attachment.  Mix the dough over low speed until a ball forms. You may need additional flour if it‚Äôs too sticky or not fully formed. If it resembles a batter add flour. If it‚Äôs flaky add a little warm water at a time. Maybe a tbsp or so.   You can knead by hand which I prefer or let the mixer do all your work. Cover with a warm moist towel in an oiled bowl and let rest for at least a half hour. I usually will use around half the dough ball per crust. I have a 12‚Äù rough pizza stone I believe. It‚Äôs old. Couldn‚Äôt tell you for sure. Roll out your dough to your liking and place on the heated up stone. Use a fork to poke holes to avoid dough bubbles.   You can use whatever sauce you want. I typically make my own which I‚Äôll give you guys. Again eyeballed everything.   32oz can San Marzano Tomatoes.   A whole head of oven roasted garlic (slice the heads off baste in olive oil salt and pepper and roast in tin foil in the oven at 425 for about a half hour).   Salt to season   Olive oil for your pot  Basil maybe a tbsp fresh finely chopped   Crushed red pepper to season for heat   Sugar maybe two tbsp. Just to cut the acidity.   Sometimes I‚Äôll add in diced onion as well. Medium low heat oil to your pot with the roasted garlic. Seems like a lot but it‚Äôs not. Roasted garlic is sweet too so it‚Äôs not going to be too bitter. If you‚Äôre using onion toss it in now. Once garlic is fragrant enough to smell toss in your tomatoes basil salt sugar and crushed red. Stir to combine. I use a hand masher to mash the tomatoes. I like the smaller chunks throughout my sauce. Immersion blender food processor whatever you want. It‚Äôs just smoother and a little less rustic but whatever you prefer. Simmer on low for 20 minutes. However long you want really there‚Äôs no wrong answer. Flavors will blend together the longer it cooks lower. Ladle onto your crust.   Cheese is up to you. This pizza I shredded fresh mozzarella burrata and some Parmesan. Honestly the burrata was new to me but it‚Äôs basically mozzarella with almost a creamy mozzarella flavored cottage cheese. It‚Äôs actually really nice and gives some true creaminess on the pizza. Shred it all down sprinkle to your liking over the top.   Every oven is temperamental. I found 450 gives my dough the perfect crisp without being raw in the middle. I‚Äôve cooked it at 400 a little longer and then moved it up to the broiler. You‚Äôre looking at around 12-15min depending on temp and your stove. Keep your light on and watch the crust.   I wish I had a pizza oven honestly. But that‚Äôs it really.   Enjoy!,i95mkvl,/r/food/comments/ussegs/homemade_cheese_pizza/i95pz0r/'

i96zexf,2022-05-19 05:21:08,manganatsu101,uspufc,[homemade] spicy pasta,Hm I read a little bit about it just now and I believe you‚Äôre correct on that. Oil doesn‚Äôt mix with water so it makes sense haha üòÇ I saw an article and I guess it works when you‚Äôre using fresh homemade pasta and for the other store bought ones you could use salt for added flavor.

i981ale,2022-05-19 09:58:50,Connman8db,uspufc,[homemade] spicy pasta,From what I understand it is sometimes used in commercial kitchens for some reason (maybe the quantities they cook) but for the average chef cooking a meal for 2-10 people it doesnt do anything except make the pasta more slippery which prevents the sauce from adhering to it.,i96zexf,/r/food/comments/uspufc/homemade_spicy_pasta/i981ale/'

i98o3d2,2022-05-19 12:33:03,NerdyNThick,uspufc,[homemade] spicy pasta,You would toss the pasta in oil *after* cooking it if you were going to have it sit idle for a while.  This way it wont turn to a single sticky pasta blob.  It does nothing while in the water.,i981ale,/r/food/comments/uspufc/homemade_spicy_pasta/i98o3d2/'
i981l0c,2022-05-19 10:00:45,Connman8db,uspufc,[homemade] spicy pasta,Theres already a ton of starch from the cooked pasta in the water.  This is why Italians always reserve a cup of pasta water instead of letting it all drain away.  Because that pasta water acts just like your thickening slurry but without adding any superfluous ingredients.,i96zoyw,/r/food/comments/uspufc/homemade_spicy_pasta/i981l0c/'

If you dont boil long enough... well you know.... gooey egg. My favorite!   I find that getting the water boiling then carefully placing the eggs in with a slotted spoon and boiling for 7 minutes then immediately put in an ice water bath until cooled makes a sliceable egg.   Dont overload the pot. Keep some space between the boiling eggs and a medium high boil will work better.

i94wlyk,2022-05-18 16:16:07,legenary4444,usp0qc,[Homemade] Chinese steamed eggs with minced pork,Yes!  Two eggs mix with salt and ground white pepper and add 200~250ml *warm* water. Mix really well. Steam for about 8 minutes (start timing after boiling). You can cover the bowl with plastic wrap and poke holes so as to keep the mixed eggs a mirror-like surface.  Minced pork toppings:   Mix ground pork with minced ginger and ground white pepper (black pepper should also be fine). Heat pan with oil add ground pork stir until it‚Äôs well separated. Add salt ground white peppersoy sauce sesame oil and little bit of sugar saut√© until the meat is dry enough. Some dark soy sauce is also preferred in this step but it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt have it it‚Äôs mostly for dark coloring.   After the eggs are steamed add a spoonful of minced pork and appropriate amount of soy sauce and enjoy! This dish goes well with white rice üçö  *the cooked minced pork is also good for other purposes so I‚Äôll suggest you cook a batch each time,i94uair,/r/food/comments/usp0qc/homemade_chinese_steamed_eggs_with_minced_pork/i94wlyk/'

If you want tonkatsu by all means go with tonkatsu or as you call it katsu sauce. Wanting ketchup as a sauce is just as valid. In fact many delicious Japanese street foods use ketchup. It is a strange and somewhat obnoxious trend to shit on our vibrant red friend as perhaps a way to flex on how worldly or mature one is. This notion however is incredibly misguided.

i95ovaf,2022-05-18 19:59:16,GinGitaxsis,usodm0,[homemade] leftover meatloaf air fried and air fried mashed potato patty sandwich with a Kraft single and some ketchup,It was not an attempt to be worldly friend. I live in the midwest of the US and the ubiquity of ketchup is a national institution. Katsu sauce is sold by the Kikomman company here in the states and I personally find it a much preferable condiment choice to old red ketchup. Tonkatsu sauce very similar to Katsu sauce in that they are both names for the same thing has a bit more body and depth for me and I have made many a meatloaf with it. Its delicious!

i97eq5q,2022-05-19 07:24:48,HorseBellies,usodm0,[homemade] leftover meatloaf air fried and air fried mashed potato patty sandwich with a Kraft single and some ketchup,Perhaps  it‚Äôs because of nostalgia as a kid and also because of the softness of the cheese you don‚Äôt even need to melt it really. You can toast a nice slice of sourdough slap some Mayo and put one slice of Kraft single cheese and quite frankly it‚Äôs just delicious simple and easy. If I made scrambled eggs I actually prefer using half of a kraft single mixed in with the egg then any other cheese because it doesn‚Äôt over power the taste of the egg. Secondly it melts much faster and I like my eggs a little runny. Perhaps it‚Äôs just a preference. I agree with you that compared to any other cheese it feels looks and def kind of tastes plasticky yet for whatever reason it‚Äôs still delicious. I can‚Äôt explain it.,i97bvwe,/r/food/comments/usodm0/homemade_leftover_meatloaf_air_fried_and_air/i97eq5q/'

For the second most common type of German dumplings which you should also try search for Semmelkn√∂del.    Its not Sauerkraut. Its rotkraut or red cabbage in English. Its not fermented but pickled in a mixture of vinegar spices fresh apples and sometimes red wine. Its really good sweeter than sauerkraut and like the German standard side vegetable for heavy festive meat dishes with sauce. (For example all sorts of roasts goulash like dishes duck and geese dishes etc.). All the dishes you would usually also serve with Kn√∂del.  Sauerkraut is more something you eat with simpler cheaper less heavy often boiled meat dishes. (Kassler Rippchen sausages). Usually also accompanied with mashed potatoes.

Schweinshaxe or Haxn is a southern dish the northern variant would be called Eisbein which is similar to the bavarian Surhaxe. Both are usually served with Sauerkraut.  In contrast to Schweinshaxe though Eisbein and Surhaxe are cured with Nitritp√∂kelsalz (similar to pink salt/prague powder).  And while Eisbein would be served with Pils Id rather have a Helles with my Haxn!,i96zufy,/r/food/comments/uskn4u/i_ate_knuckle_of_pork_with_sauerkraut_and/i971shk/'

The secret step which takes some patience is to dry the mixture to create a coating that will better adhere to the bacon. Spread it on a baking sheet tray and allow it to sit overnight. The next day grind the mixture in a blender or processor and set aside.  Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Dredge each slice of bacon in the coating mixture shaking off any excess and lay it on the rack of a roasting pan which will allow the bacon drippings to fall into the pan and keep the bacon strips crisp. Bake for 2 hours without turning until the bacon is dark brown bubbly and crisp watch carefully so it doesnt burn. Remove bacon slices with a spatula and serve warm or at room temperature. 4 to 6 servings.,i93t7d3,/r/food/comments/usjetk/homemade_candied_bacon/i93tsa0/'

Ive made this many times for brunches and never once dried the sugar mixture out.  Just elevate the bacon using a cooling rack over the baking sheet and make sure youre baking it at a low enough temp that youre rendering the fat in the bacon and not burning the sugar.  Also add some cayenne or something with a little heat to the sugar mix to balance out the sweet and savory.,i94nph5,/r/food/comments/usjetk/homemade_candied_bacon/i94zppu/'

i93zl1s,2022-05-18 12:21:37,Constantannihilation,ushi7j,[homemade] Garlic Parmesan Encrusted Pearl Onions,Onions are extremely easy to grow. Too easy. In fact if you‚Äôre gonna do it do it in planters. They‚Äôre invasive as fuck. Anecdotal but I put some alliums in my grandmas garden walkway when I was a wee lad and now it‚Äôs like bushes. Just make sure to cut the blooms off. They‚Äôre edible and strongly flavored like garlic or onion (depending on the allium of course) and they can elevate the presentation. Although many people call flowers on food pretentious many of them have actual flavor and can add to the profile.  A hearty broth some allium flowers and these pearl onions prepped this way (picked not frozen no offense) could be a great 4th or 5th pre-entree course on a fine dining menu. Obviously a much much smaller portion but that‚Äôs taking in to account that there‚Äôs x number of courses (3/5/7/9- coursed dinners can be infinitely large although I think when you get to around 14 you feel like you‚Äôre in food prison and it becomes considerably less enjoyable).,i93hknl,/r/food/comments/ushi7j/homemade_garlic_parmesan_encrusted_pearl_onions/i93zl1s/'

i93ebxk,2022-05-18 09:58:14,StovetopDiplomat,ushgb8,[Homemade] My favorite simple dessert: vanilla ice cream and maduros (fried sweet plantains),Pl√°tanos maduros are made from sweet black-skinned  plantains. These are the plantains you get on the side at a lot of Caribbean restaurants. I did a full writeup on my website [HERE](https://stovetopdiplomat.com/2022/05/17/platanos-maduros-cuban-sweet-plantains/) but the method is pretty easy - just slice your plantains fry in hot oil for a minute on each side and then lower the temp to finish cooking.

i95zpra,2022-05-18 21:41:10,sluttychinesefood,usf5lm,[homemade] prosciutto and stracchino panino,Funnily enough in Italy stracchino and prosciutto are easy and inexpensive. For example a ‚Äúsmall block‚Äù of stracchino is about 1 euro but buy this anywhere outside of Italy and you‚Äôre looking at a pricey boiii,i956yc2,/r/food/comments/usf5lm/homemade_prosciutto_and_stracchino_panino/i95zpra/'
i96d11r,2022-05-19 00:28:13,GiovanniResta,usf5lm,[homemade] prosciutto and stracchino panino,Here in Italy prosciutto crudo (as shown) especially the less salty ones (Parma San Daniele) is among the most expensive dry-cured meats you can buy.  Its much more expensive than say almost any kind of salame or mortadella.  There are less costly often local kinds of prosciutto crudo which usually are made from anterior legs (prosciutto di spalla) and/or are more salty (not an absolute rule but clearly using more salt makes the production easier).  If you want to spend even more you can buy [Culatello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culatello_di_Zibello).,i95zpra,/r/food/comments/usf5lm/homemade_prosciutto_and_stracchino_panino/i96d11r/'
i937f00,2022-05-18 09:12:00,JMetilinos,usew6y,[homemade] Peanut Butter & Jelly Cookies,Anyone looking for the recipe (copy pasted from my original comment):  Sure!   Two sticks of butter cold and cubed   1c brown sugar  1/2c white sugar  Beat in a stand mixer until fluffy then add in the following ingredients  2 eggs  1tsp vanilla extract  (Optional) dash of maple extract (this is strong!)  Pinch of salt  1tsp baking soda  1-2tbsp of peanut butter (you can omit this if you‚Äôre going for more of a cookie flavor over peanut butter)  Mix again until well combined scrape down the sides of the bowl.   Add in three cups of flour a cup at a time. Once fully combined I add in peanut butter chips. No set amount whatever your heart‚Äôs content. I used maybe half a bag of your average size at a grocery store. Again mix to combine.   This is where it got odd. This is my first time making these and it was a trial run. I recently had Gideon‚Äôs Bakehaus Pb&j cake and it inspired me.   Create a flat patty in your palm and round up the edges. Using a dinner spoon I scooped about a spoonful of grape jelly into the center of the Patty. I then took scooper more dough into my clean hand and covered the jelly and rounded it into a ball. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Preheat your oven to 400. Cover the cookies in more peanut butter chips. Bake for around 8-12 minutes or until your cookies are golden around the edges.   These make easily 6-8 cookies about 4-5‚Äù in diameter. They‚Äôre meant to be quite large.   JUST KNOW!! The jelly will be very warm initially. Let them cool COMPLETELY.  Best of luck and enjoy!

i95aqzw,2022-05-18 18:07:11,Bangarang_1,usew6y,[homemade] Peanut Butter & Jelly Cookies,A suggestion: dollop your jelly on a parchment lined sheet tray and freeze it.

i930xgy,2022-05-18 08:27:44,JMetilinos,usew6y,[homemade] Peanut Butter & Jelly Cookies,Sure!   Two sticks of butter cold and cubed   1c brown sugar  1/2 white sugar  Beat in a stand mixer until fluffy then add in the following ingredients  2 eggs  1tsp vanilla extract  (Optional) dash of maple extract (this is strong!)  Pinch of salt  1tsp baking soda  1-2tbsp of peanut butter (you can omit this if you‚Äôre going for more of a cookie flavor over peanut butter)  Mix again until well combined scrape down the sides of the bowl.   Add in three cups of flour a cup at a time. Once fully combined I add in peanut butter chips. No set amount whatever your heart‚Äôs content. I used maybe half a bag of your average size at a grocery store. Again mix to combine.   This is where it got odd. This is my first time making these and it was a trial run. I recently had Gideon‚Äôs Bakehaus Pb&j cake and it inspired me.   Create a flat patty in your palm and round up the edges. Using a dinner spoon I scooped about a spoonful of grape jelly into the center of the Patty. I then took scooper more dough into my clean hand and covered the jelly and rounded it into a ball. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Preheat your oven to 400. Cover the cookies in more peanut butter chips. Bake for around 8-12 minutes or until your cookies are golden around the edges.   These make easily 6-8 cookies about 4-5‚Äù in diameter. They‚Äôre meant to be quite large.   JUST KNOW!! The jelly will be very warm initially. Let them cool COMPLETELY.  Best of luck and enjoy!

i94o7iy,2022-05-18 15:12:17,tommychampagne,usew6y,[homemade] Peanut Butter & Jelly Cookies,Medicine argument is dumb as hell lets be honest and say 90% of users are rec users. Even a massive majority of people who get their med card only do so to avoid taxes and rec prices. Now to be clear Im not arguing it shouldnt be totally legal but its medicine! isnt the best argument. To me and most people I think it comes to the fact that alcohol has not only killed millions of people but its completely destroyed countless lives yet booze continues to be normalized and accepted by our culture...main point being weed has never killed one person. Now dont get me wrong smoking every day or most days 100% has negative affects more so on some people than others but regardless some things need to be taken into account. People say all the time weeds not physically addictive only mental...BULLSHIT. Period. If somebody thinks bud isnt physically addictive they arent smoking a lot or they are straight up lying to themselves. Physical addictions would include loss of appetite anxiety chills depression and the worst in my opinion totally not being able to get to sleep.,i93glsy,/r/food/comments/usew6y/homemade_peanut_butter_jelly_cookies/i94o7iy/'
